The following are the notes from the video 

Mohamed Arafat notes: 
After
I watched the video , Iâ€™d like to share with you my main take away points:

It is recommended to use open source language,
Python or R. and the speaker prefers Python.Python Packages:http://pandas.pydata.org/http://scikit-learn.org/stable/NumPy,
SciPy, and matplotlibhttp://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.htmlImportance of knowing SQL Language, recommended
http://sqlzoo.net/ for practicing SQL.Machine LearningRecommended
resources:https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning   (very useful course, but does the coding in
Matlap)Book :
The Elements of Statistical Learning  (for
advanced level people, not beginner)http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.htmlGood to know the basics of Bayesian statistics.
Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/
: is great for practicing machine learning , not all of data science.Stuff you probably do not need to worry
about (yet)Deep
Learning ! (unless we do image or sound related projects)Spark
/ Hadoop ! (these are mainly for Big Data. The presenter mentioned that
the companies realized they do not really need Hadoop !)Recommender
systemsAdvanced
Natural Language Processing
